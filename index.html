        <h2>Hello, Welcome to the Home Page!</h2>
        <p>This is a website for the personal use of David Foulenfont. On this website is kept a running journal of Dav's projects as well as examples of said projects for others to see. </p>
        <p>While you are welcome to stay and look at the projects, the nature of this website means it is always updating and changing. Also most of this website's functions are limited to Dav, seeing as this is a "Personal" website.</p>
        <p>If you were linked this as part of Dav's resume, please head over to the "Portfolio" page to see examples of past and current work Dav has done.</p>
